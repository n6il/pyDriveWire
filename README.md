# pyDriveWire v0.6
Python Implementation of DriveWire 4 and EmCee Protocols

PyDriveWire is a nearly complete DriveWire4 Server written in Python.  The goal is to eventually implement all of the features available.  The server also implements additional features that are not available in DriveWire4.

PyDriveWire also has support for the EmCee Protocol for use with MCX Basic on the TRS-80 MC-10.  

DriveWire 4 and EmCee Procotols can be used simultaneously on the server without reconfiguration.

# 2. <a name="ch2"></a>Getting Started

(new for v0.5c) pyDriveWire has two Easy Installtion Methods: Binary Package and Docker.  These options are designed for Ease Of Use and do not require a complex series of installation steps.   pyDriveWire can also be run directly from any `pypy` or `python` install if it meets the appropriate requirements.

In terms of performance, the Python and Binary Package installation methods are fully functional but have the lowest performance.  Docker provides a medium level of performance.  pypy should be used to get the maximum performance out of pyDriveWire.


## 2.1 Binary Package Installation
Binary packages are available at the following location:

[https://github.com/n6il/pyDriveWire/releases/latest](https://github.com/n6il/pyDriveWire/releases/latest)

Packages are available for the following operating systems:

* `linux-x86_64` -- Any modern 64-bit Linux 
* `win-x64` -- 64-bit Windows (Windows 7 or later)
* `win32` -- 32-bit Windows (Windows 7 or later)
*  `rpi3` -- Raspberry Pi 3 (Raspbian Buster)
*  `rpi4` -- Raspberry Pi 4 (Raspbian Jesse)
*  `macOs` -- macOs (High Sierra or later)

Using a Binary Package is very simple:

1. Download the package for your operating system
2. Unzip the package
3. The package contains two executable programs `pyDriveWire` and `pyDwCli` and a copy of this manual.
4. Run the `pyDriveWire` executable.  See next section for examples:
5. Full details of the command line options are in the [Command Line and Config File Options](docs/The%20pyDriveWire%20Manual.md#ch3) section.

## 2.2 Running a Binary Package
Example: Run pyDriveWire with the HTTP UI on port 6800 and use a serial port:

    pyDriveWire --ui-port 6800 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --speed 460800
    
Example: Run pyDriveWire with the HTTP UI on port 6800 and use a serial port and mount two disk images:

    pyDriveWire --ui-port 6800 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --speed 460800 \
    	/demo/test1.dsk /demo/test2.dsk

Example: Run pyDriveWire with the HTTP UI on port 6800 and the Becker port connection on port 65504:

    pyDriveWire --ui-port 6800 --accept --port 65504

## 2.3 Docker
1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Clone the container: `docker pull mikeyn6il/pydrivewire`
3. Run the container.  See next section for examples.  
4. Full details of the command line options are in the [Command Line and Config File Options](docs/The%20pyDriveWire%20Manual.md#ch3) section.

## 2.4 Running The Docker Container
Example: Run pyDriveWire with the HTTP UI on port 6800 and use a serial port:

    docker run -i -p 6800:6800/tcp -p 65504:65504/tcp \
    	--device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 mikeyn6il/pydrivewire:latest \
    	--ui-port 6800 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --speed 460800

For Windows use the following `--device` option:

    --device COM4:/dev/ttyUSB0

Example: Run pyDriveWire with the HTTP UI on port 6800 and use a serial port and use a HTTP disk image:

    docker run -i -p 6800:6800/tcp -p 65504:65504/tcp \
    	--device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 mikeyn6il/pydrivewire:latest \
    	--ui-port 6800 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --speed 460800 \
    	http://www.ocs.net/~n6il/DWTERM.dsk

Example: Run pyDriveWire with the HTTP UI on port 6800 and the Becker port connection on port 65504:

    docker run -i -p 6800:6800/tcp -p 65504:65504/tcp \
    	mikeyn6il:pydrivewire/latest \
    	--ui-port 6800 --accept --port 65504

 
## 2.4 Installation Requirements<a name="ch2.1"></a>

* pypy -- For maximum performance it is recommended to run the server with
pypy.  pypy is a Python interpreter that does JIT compilation and results in
greatly increased speed
* pyserial -- Install using pip

## 2.5 Supported Operating Systems
* Any OS where you can run Python, including but not limited to:
* Linux
* macOS
* Windows
